    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Inspired by the pizza at Bar Del Corso, this Pizza Margherita features tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, with just a hint of sea salt.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong> - 3.5 Cups</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong> - 1 Cup</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - 1 tsp</li>
        <li><strong>Active Dry Yeast</strong> - 1/4 oz</li>
        <li><strong>White Sugar</strong> - 1 Pinch</li>
        <li><strong>Flour <i>for dusting</i></strong> - 1 tsp</li>
        <li><strong>Pizza Sause</strong> - 2 Cups</li>
        <li><strong>Mozzarella Cheese</strong> - 20 Slices</li>
        <li><strong>Basil</strong> - 20 Leaves</li>
        <li><strong>Sea Salt</strong> - <i>To Taste</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: <p>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: <p>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: <p>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: <p>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: <p>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong>: <p>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong>: Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
